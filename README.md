# Zagier_project
Formal verification of Zagier's one-sentence proof of Fermat's two squares Theorem, and related proofs.

- The file lemmata.v contains prerequisites and should be compiled first.

- proof_A_Zagier.v contains Zagier's one-sentence proof.

- proof_B_partitions.v contains another short proof of Fermat's theorem due to David Christopher.

- proof_C_Jackson contains a proof of another related result, following Zagier's approach.


Required: Coq 8.13.0 and Mathcomp 1.12.0 or later versions.


The project is presented in the paper "Formal verification of Zagier's one-sentence proof"
